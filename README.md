### Project 1: Explore Weather Trends

For this project, I had to analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

### Project 2: Investigate a Dataset

For this project, I had to analyze a dataset (using the Python libraries NumPy, pandas and Matplotlib) and then communicate my findings, for questions I elaborated.

### Project 3: Analyze A/B Tests Results

For this project, I had to work to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal was to work through a notebook in order to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
