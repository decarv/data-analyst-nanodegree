### Project 1: Explore Weather Trends

For this project, I had to analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

### Project 2: Investigate a Dataset

For this project, I had to analyze a dataset (using the Python libraries NumPy, pandas and Matplotlib) and then communicate my findings, for questions I elaborated.

### Project 3: Analyze A/B Tests Results

For this project, I had to work to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal was to work through a notebook in order to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### Project 4: Wrangle and Analyze Data

For this project, I had to gather, clean and analyze data from a Tweet database of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as We Rate Dogs. We Rate Dogs is a very popular user that Tweets a picture of other userâ€™s dogs, rates and makes humorous comments about these dogs. This was the first time I had to deal with gathering data from Twitter API and cleaning untidy and what I found to be really dirty data and hard to clean.

### Project 5: Communicate Data Findings

The analysis consisted in the examination of Prosper's loan dataset, a personal loan company that provides a peer-to-peer lending marketplace, with 65056 loans listings in the dataset with 15 variables. The dataset contains data points (attributes) on loan applications, which are used by Prosper to render ratings on people that request a loan. A list of the attributes and their description can be found in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CC0PIpSdnPfxHKPzGcdtetAHGZBHJrxTfZBJ5cdZtvc/edit?usp=sharing).
